**JasyPDF** is a simple yet powerful PDF generation library, inspired by the structured and intuitive approach of **Flutter** and **Dart**. The goal of JasyPDF is to make the process of creating dynamic and fully customizable PDFs as easy as writing a UI in a modern frontend framework. This library is perfect for developers who want to generate PDFs with a clean, organized, and flexible codebase, without needing to rely on heavy third-party libraries.

### âœ¨ Features:

- **Structured PDF Creation**: Define your PDF layout with a clean, readable structure, much like how you'd build a UI in Flutter.

- **Customizable Elements**: Create dynamic pages with text, shapes, and more, with full control over styling and layout.
- **Extensible**: Add new elements, renderers, and features to suit your needs.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Enjoy a codebase that's easy to read, modify, and extend. Perfect for developers who want flexibility without complexity.

### ðŸ›  In Development:

JasyPDF is currently under active development. While the core functionality is operational, we're working on adding advanced features like:

Stay tuned for exciting new updates!

### ðŸ’¡ Inspiration:

JasyPDF draws inspiration from the simplicity and flexibility of Flutter's UI framework. We've aimed to replicate that smooth development experience for creating PDF documents in JavaScript. With JasyPDF, you don't need to worry about low-level PDF generation details â€” just focus on building your document layout.
